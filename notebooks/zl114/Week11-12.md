# Lab Notebook Entry: Final Weeks (Nov 24 – Dec 8)

## Week 11: Fall Break & Final PCB Assembly
**Date Range:** November 24, 2025 – December 1, 2025

### 1. Objectives
* Assemble the "Final Round" PCB (Round 3) which includes the fix for the programming interface (CP2102).
* Verify the "added features" (On-board USB programming & Auto-reset).
* Final preparation for the Final Demo

### 2. Work Record

#### 2.1 Soldering the Final Round PCB
During the break, I focused on assembling the final revision of the board.
* **QFN Soldering:** The CP2102 chip has a QFN package (no visible leads). I used a hot air rework station at 350°C with solder paste to reflow the chip onto the board. Checked for solder bridges under a microscope.
* **Component Population:** Soldered the ESP32-S3, the LM723 regulator, and the MOSFETs. Added the 10uF tantalum capacitors for rail stability.

#### 2.2 Feature Verification (The "Added Features")
Tested the new hardware features added in this revision.
* **USB Programming Test:** Connected the board to the laptop via the new Micro-USB port.
    * *Result:* The CP2102 was detected immediately. The auto-reset transistor circuit worked perfectly—I could upload firmware without holding the "Boot" button. This confirms the hardware fix for the programming issue.
* **Power Stability:** Verified the 3.3V rail stability while the USB was connected. The LM723 held the voltage at **3.1V**, even when drawing power for the USB-to-UART bridge.

#### 2.3 Final Mechanical Integration
* Secured the fully populated PCB into the lamp base.
* Tidied up the internal wiring (zip ties and hot glue) to ensure nothing rattles during the demo transport.

## Week 12: Final Demo & Documentation
**Date Range:** December 1, 2025 – December 8, 2025

### 1. Objectives
* Present the Final Demo to the course staff.
* Record final verification data (Lux and Power).
* Submit Final Paper and Lab Notebook.

### 2. Work Record

#### 2.1 Final Demonstration
Set up the lamp station for the live grading.
* **Setup:** Connected the lamp to the 12V supply. Placed a lux meter on the desk surface.
* **Live Test:**
    1.  **Dark Room:** Covered the sensors. Lamp brightened to max. Measured **411 Lux**.
    2.  **Daylight Sim:** Shined a light on the photoresistor. Lamp dimmed correctly. Measured **478 Lux**.
    3.  **Power Check:** Showed the multimeter reading dropping from **1.58A** (Dark) to **1.23A** (Daylight), proving the efficiency requirement.
* **Result:** The demo was successful. The hardware performed reliably without overheating or flickering.

#### 2.2 Documentation Wrap-up
* **Final Paper:** Completed the "Design Verification" section using the data gathered during the demo. Finalized the "Cost Analysis" based on the final components used.
* **Notebook:** Compiled all weekly entries (schematic sketches, soldering photos, and debugging notes) into the final GitHub repository.
* **Lab Checkout:** Cleared the workbench, returned the oscilloscope probes and shared lab equipment.

### 3. Project Conclusion
The project is complete. The hardware successfully meets the requirements of flicker-free dimming (using 1kHz PWM) and efficient power regulation (using the custom LM723 circuit). The switch to the Photoresistor solved the dynamic range issues encountered earlier in the semester.
