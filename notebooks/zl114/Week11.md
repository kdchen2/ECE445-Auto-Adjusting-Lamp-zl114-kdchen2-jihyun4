# Lab Notebook Entry: Project Conclusion
**Date Range:** December 8, 2025 – December 11, 2025

### 1. Objectives
* Deliver the Final Presentation to course staff and peers.
* Finalize and submit the ECE 445 Final Paper.
* Complete the Lab Checkout process (return equipment, clear locker).

### 2. Work Record

#### 2.1 Final Presentation
We delivered our final presentation, covering the Problem, Solution, Design details, and Verification results.
* **Demonstration:** During the Q&A, we demonstrated the lamp's ability to react to a flashlight (simulated sun) by dimming the LEDs. The transition was smooth (no flicker), confirming our 2% rate-limiting algorithm works as intended.
* **Feedback:** The presentation went very well. We effectively communicated the design choices, specifically justifying the switch from the OPT101 sensor to the Photoresistor due to saturation issues.

#### 2.2 Final Paper Submission
* Completed the final edits on the report.
* **Verification:** Ensured all data tables (Lux measurements, Power efficiency of 35.2%) matched the results gathered during the demo.
* **Formatting:** Checked against ECE 445 guidelines (citations, figure captions, and IEEE reference
