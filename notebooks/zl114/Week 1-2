# Bi-Weekly Lab Notebook Entry: Weeks 1-2

## Week 1: Project Proposal & Component Research
**Date Range:** September 15, 2025 – September 22, 2025

### 1. Objectives
* Finalize project idea: "Auto-Adjusted Smart Desk Lamp."
* Meet with TA (Zhuoer Zhang) to discuss feasibility.
* Draft and submit the Project Proposal and Team Contract.
* Select and order major components (ESP32, voltage regulator, sensors).
* Define high-level requirements (Lux targets, power efficiency).

### 2. Work Record

#### 2.1 Component Selection & Research
We determined the core components required to meet our requirements of 450 Lux output and color temperature adjustment (2700K–6500K).

* **Microcontroller:** Selected **ESP32-S3 (WROOM-1)**.
    * *Reasoning:* We need two ADC channels (one for the photoresistor/OPT101, one for internal monitoring) and I2C for the color sensor. The ESP32 also has high-resolution PWM (LEDC) needed for smooth dimming (Target: <2% change/sec).
* **Power Regulation:** Selected **LM723CN**.
    * *Reasoning:* We
